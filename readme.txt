This simple WordPress plugin allows users to add quick menu items to the WordPress sidebar. It's designed to help web masters have easy access to external pages such as Analytics and shopping carts in their WordPress admin panel.

The plugin works by creating a new menu and placing it on the left side of your WordPress control panel, it's not designed to be seen by visitors to the website itself, only to improve the experience for the webmaster.

You can add new menu items, adjust the security level for each and have the menu items link to external or internal pages for easy access.
